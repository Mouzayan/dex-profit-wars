 * @title DexProfitWars
 * @author em_mutable
 * @notice DexProfitWars is a gamified trading enhancement protocol built on Uniswap V4 that rewards
 *         skilled traders with bonus tokens funded by sponsors. Sponsors (protocols, DAOs, or
 *         projects) deposit reward tokens into bonus pools and define custom reward parameters for
 *         specific trading pairs.
 *
 *         Core Mechanics
 *         Trading Brackets & Rewards:
 *              - Trades are categorized into three size brackets:
 *                  1. Small: 0.01 - 0.1 ETH
 *                  2. Medium: 0.1 - 1 ETH
 *                  3. Large: 1 - 10 ETH
 *              - Each bracket maintains separate leaderboards in the UI
 *              - Minimum 2% profit threshold required to qualify for rewards
 *              - Profit calculation uses percentage-based returns within each bracket
 *
 *         Reward Pool Distribution
 *              Based on total value of the reward pool :
 *                  1. Small Pool (< 1000 USDC equivalent)
 *                      Single winner (100%) or Two winners (70/30)
 *                  2. Standard Pool (1000-10000 USDC equivalent)
 *                      Three winners (50/30/20)
 *                  3. Large Pool (> 10000 USDC equivalent)
 *                      Five winners (40/25/15/12/8)
 *
 *         Sponsor Mechanics:
 *              - One active sponsor pool at a time
 *              - Sponsors provide reward tokens separate from the trading pair
 *              - 48-hour grace period between sponsor transitions
 *              - Unclaimed rewards returnable to sponsor after reward pool expiration
 *
 *         Reward Distribution:
 *              - Distribution triggered after:
 *                  - Trading window completion (e.g. 7 days)
 *                  - Mandatory cooldown period (e.g. 24 hours)
 *              - Automatic distribution to qualifying traders
 *              - Rewards paid in sponsor's designated token
 *
 *         Sponsor Customizable Parameters:
 *              - Trading window duration
 *              - Bonus pool size and token
 *              - Trade size limits per bracket
 *              - Minimum profit thresholds
 *              - Cooldown periods
 *
 *         Anti-manipulation safeguards:
 *             1. Trade Controls
 *                 - Bracket-specific size limits
 *                 - Time delays between trades
 *                 - Rate limiting per wallet
 *             2. Economic Security
 *                 - Maximum slippage tolerance
 *                 - Pool utilization limits
 *                 - Minimum profit requirements
 *             3. MEV Protection
 *                 - Distribution delays
