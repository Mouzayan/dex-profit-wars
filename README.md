## DexProfitWars

**DexProfitWars** is a gamified trading enhancement hook that rewards traders with bonus tokens funded by sponsors. Sponsors (protocols, DAOs, or projects) deposit tokens into bonus pools in the hook and define custom reward parameters for the trading pair.
When traders execute profitable swaps that meet the sponsor's criteria, they automatically receive a bonus of up to 10% on their traded amounts, drawn from the sponsor's bonus pool. Sponsors customize their reward mechanics by setting minimum trade sizes, specific trading windows, and variable bonus rates based on profit margins.

For example, a sponsor might offer a 5% bonus for trades with 1-3% profit margins, scaling up to 10% for trades exceeding 5% profit.
This creates a fun, tournament-like atmosphere around everyday trading while providing sponsors with a way to incentivize liquidity and engagement with their token pairs.
The mechanism could play into memecoin launches / airdrops etc..

Sybil resistance problem:
Since the hook is public if you get value from it thereâ€™s an incentive to spin up lots of accounts and then use them to drain the incentives pool.
Need to think about how to id qualified users from their wallet address, and how you to filter out abuse.
